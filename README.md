# Research database template

A research database is a tool for conducting systematic literature reviews. It helps researchers to store and organise the information that they extracted from primary sources. The research database also store the codebook that describes the extracted information, showing the features from the sources that were extracted and the possible values of each feature. 

This repository contains an empty research database that you can use for your own literature review project (`template_research_db.db`). This empty research database is implemented in SQLite. Its schema is available in `Schema/` folder. For your reference, a sample research database is also provided (`sample_research_db.db`).

## Prerequisite

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). 
- Graphical manager for SQLite. [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl) is recommended for ease of use.
- Git and GitHub.
- [StarUML](https://staruml.io) (Optional, if you want to view and edit the schema model).
